# PortfolioRevisited

Here is an updated portfolio with more recent and more complex projects

In this project I am utilizing HTML CSS and Bootstrap for the JavaScript functions.

This portfolio serves to show what I have learned since the first portfoliio assignment. It encorporates a CSS framework that makes it
responsive.

Here is a link for the deployed website:
